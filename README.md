## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

styled-components was something that I was not even aware existed until I started this project, and I was a bit intimidated by it. But when I started experimenting with it, I found that this was pretty fun to learn and quite useful, especially with being able to add media view right under that particular component. I also did not know much about react beside from what I have learned from Helsinki University's fullstackopen course, so I decided to do this project as a react app, which worked perfectly with styled-components as I needed to use useState for some parts.

### Useful resources

- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics) - This helped me get started with styled-components. The examples were clear and super useful in building my understanding.
- Special thanks to the 20+ stack-overflow pages that I can finally close after 6 hours of creating this project!
